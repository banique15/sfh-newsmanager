# User Cancels (Cancel)

## Overview

We've sent a confirmation prompt; the user clicks Cancel.

This is the cancellation flow - acknowledge and do nothing to the database.

## Why This Approach

Respecting user's decision to cancel ensures they're in control and prevents unwanted changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Required context:**
  - The proposed action (that's now being cancelled)

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Acknowledge the Cancellation**

**Action:** Reply in a friendly way.

**Message examples:**

**General:**
> "No problem. Let me know if you need anything else."

**Context-specific:**
> "No problem. The article wasn't created."

> "Understood. The article wasn't changed."

> "Got it. The article will stay as a draft."

> "No worries. The article wasn't deleted."

### 2. **Do Nothing to the Database**

**Action:** No create, update, delete, publish, or unpublish is performed.

**Important:**
- Don't modify article data
- Don't change status
- Don't delete anything
- Don't generate images (if that was part of the proposed action)

---

## Expected Outcome

User is reassured that nothing was changed. They can continue with a different request or clarify what they want.

## Error Handling

No errors - cancellation is always safe.

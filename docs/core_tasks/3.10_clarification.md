# When We Need More Information (Clarification)

## Overview

User sends a request that's ambiguous or missing something we need (e.g., "Create an article", "Update it", "Add an image").

Guessing could create or change the wrong content, so we ask short, specific questions instead of assuming.

## Why This Approach

Guessing risks creating wrong or duplicate content. Asking specific questions ensures we understand user intent before taking action.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Detect what's ambiguous or missing
  - `clarification_prompt` - Ask targeted questions
  
- **Required context:**
  - The user's original request

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Ambiguity or Missing Info**

**Action:** Notice when we can't safely proceed.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`

**Common scenarios:**
- **No topic:** "Create an article" (about what?)
- **No article specified:** "Update it" (which one?)
- **Multiple matches:** "Update the event article" (which event?)
- **No image description:** "Add an image" (what should it show?)
- **Ambiguous pronouns:** "It", "that one" with no context

### 2. **Ask One or a Few Clear Questions**

**Action:** Reply in plain language with concrete options when possible.

**Tool(s) used:** `clarification_prompt`

**Good clarification patterns:**

**Missing topic:**
> "What should the article be about?"

**Ambiguous article reference:**
> "Which article should I update? 
> 1. Summer Concert Series 2026
> 2. Summer Fundraiser Update  
> 3. Summer Youth Program"

**Missing details:**
> "Should I create it as a draft or publish it right away?"

**Image description missing:**
> "What should the image show?"

**Confirmation on duplicate:**
> "We already have an article titled 'Summer Event'. Do you want to:
> 1. Create a new one with a different title
> 2. Update the existing one"

### 3. **Wait for the User's Answer**

**Action:** Don't execute create/update/delete until they've answered.

**Next steps:**
- User provides answer → Return to appropriate task flow
- Follow-up messages are interpreted in context

---

## Expected Outcome

User knows exactly what we need and can answer in one message; we then proceed with less risk of wrong or duplicate content.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **Still unclear after clarification** | Ask another specific question or rephrase |
| **User says "nevermind"** | "No problem. Let me know if you need anything else." |

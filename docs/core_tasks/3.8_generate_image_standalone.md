# Generate an Image Only (Standalone Asset)

## Overview

User asks for an image without tying it to an article in the same step (e.g., "Generate a hero image for the gala campaign", "Create a banner for the fundraiser").

Sometimes the user only needs the asset; we generate it, store it so it has a stable URL, and hand them that URL.

## Why This Approach

Image-only generation doesn't modify database content, so we can generate and return it immediately without confirmation. User decides whether and how to use it.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse image request
  - `image_generation` - Create the image
  - `image_storage` - Upload and get permanent URL
  
- **Required context:**
  - What kind of image (hero, banner, graphic, etc.)
  - What it should show or convey

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Understand the Request**

**Action:** Figure out what kind of image and what it should show.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`

**Extract:**
- **Image type:** hero image, banner, social media graphic, etc.
- **Subject/theme:** what it's for (gala, concert, fundraiser, etc.)
- **Description details:** colors, mood, elements to include

**If unclear:** Ask "What should the image show?" or "What's it for?"

### 2. **Generate the Image**

**Action:** Create the image from a detailed description.

**Tool(s) used:** `image_generation`

**Prompt structure:**
```
Create a [type] image for [organization: Sing for Hope] about [topic/theme].

Style: [inspiring/vibrant/professional/celebratory]
Elements: [specific items to include]
Mood: [warm/energetic/elegant]
```

**Example:**
> "Create a hero image for Sing for Hope about the annual gala fundraiser. Style: elegant and inspiring. Elements: arts, community, celebration. Mood: warm and uplifting."

---

### 3. **Upload and Get a Link**

**Action:** Store the image so it's available at a permanent URL.

**Tool(s) used:** `image_storage`

**Returns:** Permanent URL (e.g., `https://cdn.singforhope.org/images/gala-hero-2026.jpg`)

---

### 4. **Give the User the Image and URL**

**Action:** Show preview (where channel allows) and provide URL.

**Message format:**
```
Here's your [type] image for [topic]:

[Image preview if supported]

URL: [permanent link]

You can use this in an article, download it, or let me know if you'd like me to add it to an existing article.
```

**Example:**
> "Here's your hero image for the gala campaign:
> 
> ![Gala Hero Image](https://cdn.singforhope.org/images/gala-hero-2026.jpg)
> 
> URL: https://cdn.singforhope.org/images/gala-hero-2026.jpg
> 
> You can use this in an article, download it, or let me know if you'd like me to add it to an existing article!"

## Expected Outcome

User gets a generated image with permanent URL they can reuse. No article changes made.

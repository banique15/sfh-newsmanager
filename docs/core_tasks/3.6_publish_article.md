# Publish an Article (Make it Live)

## Overview

User asks to publish an article or make it live (e.g., "Publish it", "Make the summer event article live", "Go live with that one").

Publishing makes content visible on the site, so we treat it as a change that needs confirmation when the target article isn't obvious.

## Why This Approach

Publishing makes content visible on the site, so we confirm which article and get approval to prevent accidentally publishing the wrong content or unprepared drafts.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse publish request
  - `context_resolution` - Resolve "it", "that one"
  - `article_search` - Find article by title/topic
  - `article_status` - Change status to published
  - `yes_no_prompt` - Get approval
  - `conversation_memory` - Track published article
  
- **Required context:**
  - Which article to publish

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Identify Which Article**

**Action:** Use user's words and context to resolve which draft (or article) they mean.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`, `context_resolution`, `article_search`

**Resolution strategies:**
1. **Explicit title** - "Publish 'Summer Concert 2026'"
2. **Context reference** - "Publish it" → check conversation memory
3. **Topic reference** - "Publish the gala article" → search
4. **Status filter** - Prefer drafts over already-published

**If multiple match:** Follow [4.2_multiple_matches.md](../edge_cases/4.2_multiple_matches.md)

**If unclear:** Follow [3.10_clarification.md](3.10_clarification.md)

### 2. **Confirm Before Publishing**

**Action:** State which article we'll publish and offer Yes/Cancel.

**Tool(s) used:** `yes_no_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
I'll publish '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' and make it live on the website.

[Show current status if helpful: "Currently a draft"]

Is this correct?
```

**Options:** [Yes] [Cancel]

**Examples:**
> "I'll publish 'Summer Concert Series 2026' and make it live on the website. Currently a draft. Is this correct?"

> "I'll make 'Gala Night Announcement' live. Is this correct?"

---

### 3. **Publish Only After Confirmation**

**Action:** Set article status to published so it appears on the site.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_status`

**On Yes:**
```json
{
  "operation": "publish",
  "article_id": "[resolved ID]"
}
```

**This triggers:**
- Status change from "draft" to "published"  
- `published_at` timestamp set to now
- Article becomes visible on public website

**On Cancel:** Follow [3.12_user_cancels.md](3.12_user_cancels.md)

---

### 4. **Confirm and Share Link if Possible**

**Action:** Tell them it's live and provide public link when available.

**Success message:**
```
✅ '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' is now live!

[Public URL if available]

The article is visible on the website.
```

**Example:**
> "✅ 'Summer Concert Series 2026' is now live!
> 
> https://singforhope.org/news/summer-concert-series-2026
> 
> The article is visible on the website."

**Store in memory:** Published article for potential follow-ups ("unpublish it", "update it")

---

## Expected Outcome

The chosen article's status changes to "published", it appears on the public website, and user receives confirmation with link.

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Can't identify article** | "Which article should I publish?" (see 3.10) |
| **Multiple matches** | "Which one? 1. [title - draft] 2. [title - draft]..." (see 4.2) |
| **Article not found** | "I couldn't find that article. Could you specify the title?" |
| **Already published** | "That article is already live. Would you like to unpublish it or make changes?" |
| **Publish failed** | "Something went wrong publishing. The article is still a draft. Please try again." |
| **User cancels** | "No problem. The article will stay as a draft." (see 3.12) |

# Delete Content

## Overview

User asks to remove an article (e.g., "Delete the old event post", "Remove that article").

Deletion is irreversible, so we require explicit confirmation and state clearly what will be removed.

## Why This Approach

Deletion is irreversible, so we require explicit confirmation and state clearly what will be removed to prevent accidental data loss.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse delete request
  - `context_resolution` - Resolve "it", "that one"
  - `article_search` - Find article by title/topic
  - `article_crud` - Perform delete operation
  - `yes_no_prompt` - Get explicit approval
  - `conversation_memory` - Clear deleted article from memory
  
- **Required context:**
  - Which article to delete

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Identify What Would Be Deleted**

**Action:** Resolve which article they mean from their message and context.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`, `context_resolution`, `article_search`

**Resolution strategies:**
1. **Explicit title** - "Delete 'Old Summer Event'"
2. **Topic reference** - "Delete the event article" → search and confirm
3. **Context reference** - "Delete it" → check conversation memory
4. **Link provided** - See [4.4_user_provides_link.md](../edge_cases/4.4_user_provides_link.md)

**If multiple match:** Follow [4.2_multiple_matches.md](../edge_cases/4.2_multiple_matches.md)

**If unclear:** Follow [3.10_clarification.md](3.10_clarification.md)

---

### 2. **Ask for Confirmation**

**Action:** State clearly what will be removed with warning that it can't be undone.

**Tool(s) used:** `yes_no_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
⚠️ I'll permanently delete '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' ([status: draft/published]).

This can't be undone.

Are you sure?
```

**Include:**
- Article title
- Status (so they know if it's live)
- Warning about irreversibility

**Options:** [Yes] [Cancel]

**Example:**
> "⚠️ I'll permanently delete 'Old Summer Event 2024' (currently published). This can't be undone. Are you sure?"

---

### 3. **Delete Only After Confirmation**

**Action:** If they confirm, delete that record. If they cancel, do nothing.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_crud`

**On Yes:**
```json
{
  "operation": "delete",
  "article_id": "[resolved ID]"
}
```

**On Cancel:** Follow [3.12_user_cancels.md](3.12_user_cancels.md)

**After deletion:**
- Remove from `conversation_memory`
- Proceed to step 4

---

### 4. **Confirm the Result**

**Action:** Tell them the content was removed or explain failure.

**Success message:**
```
✅ Deleted '[ARTICLE_TITLE]'.

The article has been permanently removed.
```

**Example:**
> "✅ Deleted 'Old Summer Event 2024'. The article has been permanently removed from the website."

**Failure handling:**
- If article not found: "I couldn't find that article. It may have already been deleted."
- If database error: "Something went wrong. The article might not have been deleted. Please check or try again."

---

## Expected Outcome

User knowingly approves the removal with clear warning, article is deleted from database, and user receives confirmation.

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Can't identify article** | "Which article should I delete?" (see 3.10) |
| **Multiple matches** | "Which one should I delete? 1. [title] 2. [title]..." (see 4.2) |
| **Article not found** | "I couldn't find that article. It may have already been deleted." |
| **Delete failed** | "Something went wrong. The article might not have been deleted. Please try again or let me know if you need help." |
| **User cancels** | "No problem. The article wasn't deleted." (see 3.12) |
| **Trying to undo** | See [4.6_undo_revert.md](../edge_cases/4.6_undo_revert.md) |

# Unpublish an Article (Take it Down)

## Overview

User asks to take an article off the site or make it draft again (e.g., "Take it down", "Unpublish that article", "Make it draft again").

Unpublishing hides content from the public; we confirm which article and that the user really wants to do it.

## Why This Approach

Unpublishing hides content from the public view, so we confirm which article and get approval to prevent accidentally removing live content.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse unpublish request
  - `context_resolution` - Resolve "it", "that one"
  - `article_search` - Find article by title/topic
  - `article_status` - Change status to draft
  - `yes_no_prompt` - Get approval
  - `conversation_memory` - Track unpublished article
  
- **Required context:**
  - Which article to unpublish

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Identify Which Article**

**Action:** Resolve which published article they mean.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`, `context_resolution`, `article_search`

**Resolution strategies:**
1. **Explicit title** - "Unpublish 'Old Event Post'"
2. **Context reference** - "Take it down" → check conversation memory
3. **Topic reference** - "Unpublish the gala article" → search
4. **Status filter** - Prefer published over drafts

**If multiple match:** Follow [4.2_multiple_matches.md](../edge_cases/4.2_multiple_matches.md)

**If unclear:** Follow [3.10_clarification.md](3.10_clarification.md)

### 2. **Confirm Before Unpublishing**

**Action:** State which article we'll unpublish and offer Yes/Cancel.

**Tool(s) used:** `yes_no_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
I'll unpublish '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' and remove it from the website.

It will be saved as a draft.

Is this correct?
```

**Options:** [Yes] [Cancel]

**Example:**
> "I'll unpublish 'Old Summer Event 2024' and remove it from the website. It will be saved as a draft. Is this correct?"

---

### 3. **Unpublish Only After Confirmation**

**Action:** Set article back to draft so it's no longer visible on the site.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_status`

**On Yes:**
```json
{
  "operation": "unpublish",
  "article_id": "[resolved ID]"
}
```

**This triggers:**
- Status change from "published" to "draft"
- Article removed from public website
- `published_at` timestamp preserved (for record keeping)

**On Cancel:** Follow [3.12_user_cancels.md](3.12_user_cancels.md)

---

### 4. **Confirm the Result**

**Action:** Tell them the article is no longer live.

**Success message:**
```
✅ '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' is no longer live.

The article is now a draft and not visible on the website.

[Optional: "You can republish it anytime."]
```

**Example:**
> "✅ 'Old Summer Event 2024' is no longer live. The article is now a draft and not visible on the website. You can republish it anytime or delete it permanently."

**Store in memory:** Unpublished article for potential follow-ups

---

## Expected Outcome

The chosen article's status changes to "draft", it's removed from public website, and user receives confirmation.

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Can't identify article** | "Which article should I unpublish?" (see 3.10) |
| **Multiple matches** | "Which one? 1. [title - published] 2. [title - published]..." (see 4.2) |
| **Article not found** | "I couldn't find that article." |
| **Already draft** | "That article is already a draft (not live). Did you mean to delete it or publish it?" |
| **Unpublish failed** | "Something went wrong. The article is still live. Please try again." |
| **User cancels** | "No problem. The article will stay live." (see 3.12) |

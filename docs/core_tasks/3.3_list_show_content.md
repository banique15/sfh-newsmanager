# Show or List Content (Read-Only)

## Overview

User asks to see articles or news (e.g., "Show me the latest articles", "List drafts", "What do we have about the gala?", "What's live right now?").

This is a read-only operation that fetches and displays article information without making any changes.

## Why This Approach

Read-only requests don't change anything, so we run them right away and present results in plain language without requiring confirmation.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse what type of list/search user wants
  - `article_search` - Fetch matching articles from database
  - `conversation_memory` - Store results for potential follow-ups
  
- **Required context:**
  - Search criteria (status, topic, date range, etc.)
  
- **Channel considerations:**
  - Format results appropriately for channel (list vs table vs cards)

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Understand the Request**

**Action:** Figure out what they want to see: latest, drafts only, published only, by topic, by date, etc.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`

**Extract filters:**
- **Status:** draft, published, or all
- **Topic/keyword:** specific subject matter
- **Date range:** latest, specific dates, etc.
- **Limit:** how many to show (default 10-20)

**Common query types:**
- "Show me the latest articles" → published, sorted by date, limit 10
- "List drafts" → status=draft, all
- "What do we have about the gala?" → keyword="gala", all statuses
- "What's live right now?" → status=published

### 2. **Fetch the Right Data**

**Action:** Look up matching articles with sensible limits.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_search`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "status": "draft|published|all",
  "keyword": "optional search term",
  "sort_by": "created_at|published_at|updated_at",
  "sort_order": "desc|asc",
  "limit": 10-20
}
```

**Apply sensible defaults:**
- Limit to 10-20 results to avoid overwhelming
- Sort by most recent first
- If no status specified, show all

---

### 3. **Present Results in a Friendly Way**

**Action:** Show titles, excerpts, status, dates in readable format.

**Format for each article:**
```
[Status badge] Title
- Excerpt/summary
- Created: [date]
- [Status: draft/published on date]
[Link if available]
```

**If no results:** Follow [4.11_no_results.md](../edge_cases/4.11_no_results.md)

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 articles about the gala:

📝 DRAFT: Gala Night 2026 - Save the Date
- Join us for our annual fundraising gala this fall...
- Created: Feb 1, 2026

✅ PUBLISHED: Gala Night 2025 Recap

- Published: Nov 21, 2025

📝 DRAFT: Gala Planning Committee Update
- We're excited to announce our planning committee...
- Created: Jan 15, 2026
```

**Store in memory:** List of article IDs for potential follow-up ("update the first one", "publish that draft")

---

## Expected Outcome

User sees the list or details they asked for so they can decide what to edit, publish, or work with next. No database changes made.

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **No results found** | "There are no [drafts/articles about X] right now." Suggest creating one. (see 4.11) |
| **Search failed** | "I couldn't search the articles right now. Please try again." |
| **Ambiguous query** | "Are you looking for drafts, published articles, or both?" (clarify status) |

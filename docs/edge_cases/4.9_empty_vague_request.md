# Empty or Very Vague Request

## Overview

User sends "help", "article", an empty message, or something equally vague with no clear intent.

We don't assume intent. We reply with a short, friendly list of what we can do and ask them to specify.

## Why This Approach

Making assumptions about vague requests risks doing the wrong thing. Better to clarify upfront.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `clarification_prompt` - Show capabilities and ask for clarification

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Vague/Empty Request**

**Scenarios:**
- "help"
- "article"
- "news"
- Empty message
- One-word requests without context

---

### 2. **Show What We Can Do**

**Action:** Provide friendly list of capabilities and ask what they need.

**Tool(s) used:** `clarification_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
I can help you with news articles! Here's what I can do:

- Create a new article (with or without images)
- Update an existing article
- Publish or unpublish articles
- List drafts or published articles
- Generate images for articles
- Delete articles

What would you like to do?
```

**Alternative (shorter):**
> "What would you like to do? I can create articles, update them, publish/unpublish, list articles, add images, or delete content."

---

### 3. **Wait for Clarification**

**Action:** User provides more specific request.

**Then:** Route to appropriate task flow

---

## Expected Outcome

User knows what's possible and provides clearer request. No unwanted actions taken.

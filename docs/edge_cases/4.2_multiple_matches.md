# "Which Article?" When Multiple Could Match

## Overview

User says "update the event article" or "publish it" and there are several articles that could match (e.g., multiple event articles or multiple drafts).

We don't guess. We list the candidates in plain language and ask them to pick.

## Why This Approach

Guessing which article could lead to modifying wrong content. Listing options lets user choose explicitly.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `article_search` - Find matching articles
  - `clarification_prompt` - Present options

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Identify Multiple Matches**

**Action:** Search returns more than one article matching the criteria.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_search`

**Common scenarios:**
- "update the event article" → 3 event articles found
- "publish it" with no clear recent context → multiple drafts
- "delete the gala post" → multiple gala-related articles

---

### 2. **List Candidates**

**Action:** Present options in numbered list with distinguishing details.

**Tool(s) used:** `clarification_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
Which article do you mean?

1. [Title] - [status] - [created/published date]
2. [Title] - [status] - [created/published date]
3. [Title] - [status] - [created/published date]

Please choose by number or title.
```

**Include distinguishing details:**
- Title
- Status (draft/published)
- Date (created or published)
- Brief excerpt if helpful

**Example:**
> "Which article do you mean?
> 
> 1. Summer Concert Series 2026 - draft - created Feb 4
> 2. Summer Fundraiser Event - published - published Jan 15
> 3. Summer Youth Program Launch - draft - created Feb 1
> 
> Please choose by number or title."

### 3. **Wait for Selection**

**Action:** User picks one (by number, title, or description).

**Accepted responses:**
- "1" or "the first one"
- "Summer Concert Series 2026"
- "the draft one"

**Once selected:**
- Resolve to specific article ID
- Proceed with original operation ([3.4_update_content.md](../core_tasks/3.4_update_content.md), [3.6_publish_article.md](../core_tasks/3.6_publish_article.md), etc.)

---

## Expected Outcome

User explicitly picks one article from the list; we then proceed with that specific article.

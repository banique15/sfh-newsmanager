# List or Search Returns Nothing

## Overview

User asks "show me drafts about the gala" or "what do we have about X?" and there are no matching articles.

We reply in plain language that we didn't find any, and optionally suggest creating one or broadening the search.

## Why This Approach

Clear "no results" messaging prevents confusion and offers constructive next steps.

## Prerequisites

None - simple response

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Empty Results**

**Scenarios:**
- Search by topic returns 0 articles
- Filter by status (drafts/published) returns 0
- "Latest articles" when database is empty

---

### 2. **Tell User No Matches Found**

**Message format:**
```
There are no [criteria] right now.

[Optional: suggest action]
```

**Examples:**

**No drafts about topic:**
> "There are no drafts about the gala right now. Would you like me to create one?"

**No articles match keyword:**
> "No articles match 'fundraiser'. Want to create an article about the fundraiser?"

**No published articles:**
> "There are no published articles right now. All articles are still drafts."

**No drafts:**
> "There are no drafts. All articles have been published."

**General no results:**
> "I couldn't find any articles matching that."

---

### 3. **Suggest Next Steps (Optional)**

**Actionable suggestions:**
- "Would you like me to create one?"
- "Want to see all articles instead?"
- "Try searching for a different topic?"

---

## Expected Outcome

User understands no matches were found and has option to take action (create, broaden search, etc.).

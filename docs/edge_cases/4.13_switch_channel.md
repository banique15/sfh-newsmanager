# Switching Channels (Slack → Email → Portal)

## Overview

User creates article via Slack, then asks about it via Email or Portal.

Long-term conversation memory should allow cross-channel context when possible.

## Why This Approach

Users may naturally switch channels; maintaining context improves experience.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Check User Identity**

Identify same user across channels (email address, user ID, etc.)

### 2. **Access Cross-Channel Memory**

**Tool(s) used:** `conversation_memory`

**If user identity matches:**
- Access recent articles created/mentioned by this user
- Resolve pronouns using cross-channel history

**If identity unclear:**
- Ask for clarification
- Require explicit article identification

### 3. **Fallback to Explicit Identification**

If context unclear across channels, ask:
> "Which article do you mean? (I see you recently worked on: 1. [Title A] 2. [Title B])"

## Expected Outcome

Seamless cross-channel experience when possible; clear clarification when needed.

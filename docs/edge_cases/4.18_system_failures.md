# System Failures or Downtime

## Overview

Database is offline, API is down, or another system component isn't working.

We detect the failure, explain it in simple terms, and suggest trying again later or contacting support.

## Why This Approach

Transparent communication about technical issues helps user understand it's not their fault and provides clear next steps.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect System Failure**

**Common failures:**
- Database connection timeout
- API rate limit exceeded
- Image generation service down
- Authentication failure

### 2. **Explain in Plain Language**

**Message format:**
> "Something went wrong on our end: [simple description].
> 
> Please try again in a few minutes. If it still doesn't work, [contact support/let me know]."

**Examples:**

**Database down:**
> "I can't connect to the article database right now. Please try again in a few minutes."

**Image service down:**
> "The image generation service isn't responding. I can still create text-only articles, or please try adding an image again later."

**Rate limit:**
> "We've hit a rate limit. Please wait a minute and try again."

**General error:**
> "Something went wrong. Please try again, or rephrase your request."

### 3. **Suggest Actions**

- "Try again in [timeframe]"
- "Let me know if you need help"
- "Contact support at [email/link]" (for persistent issues)

## Expected Outcome

User understands it's a technical issue, not their mistake, and knows to retry or get help.

# Request Fails Partway (Partial Failure)

## Overview

We generated an image and then the save to database failed (or opposite: save succeeded but image upload failed).

We tell the user what happened in simple terms, what worked and what didn't, and suggest next steps.

## Why This Approach

Partial failures need clear communication so user knows what succeeded and what to retry.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `error_handler` - Format plain language error messages

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Partial Failure**

**Common scenarios:**

**Article saved, image failed:**
- Article created/updated successfully
- Image generation or upload failed
- Result: Article exists without image

**Image created, article failed:**
- Image generated and uploaded
- Article save to database failed
- Result: Image URL but no article

---

### 2. **Explain What Happened**

**Action:** Tell user in simple terms what worked and what didn't.

**Tool(s) used:** `error_handler`

**Message format:**
```
[What succeeded], but [what failed].

[What they have now]
[What they can do next]
```

**Examples:**

**Article saved, image failed:**
> "The article 'Summer Concert 2026' was created, but the image didn't generate. 
> 
> Here's the article: [link]
> 
> You can try adding an image again, or let me know if you need help."

**Image succeeded, article failed:**
> "The image was created, but something went wrong saving the article.
> 
> Here's the image: [URL]
> 
> You can try creating the article again, or paste the content again and I'll save it with this image."

**Update succeeded, image upload failed:**
> "I updated the article content successfully, but the new hero image didn't upload.
> 
> The article has your new content: [link]
> 
> Want to try uploading the image again?"

### 3. **Provide Next Steps**

**Actionable suggestions:**
- "Try again" (for temporary errors)
- "Add the image separately" (if article exists)
- "Use this image URL in the article" (if image exists)
- "Let me know if you need help"

## Expected Outcome

User understands what succeeded and what failed, knows current state, and has clear next steps.

# Scheduling or "Publish Later"

## Overview

User asks to "publish this on Friday" or "schedule for next week".

Scheduled publishing is not currently supported. We explain this clearly and offer alternatives.

## Why This Approach

Honesty about current limitations with clear alternatives maintains trust.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Scheduling Request**

**Phrases:**
- "Publish on [date]"
- "Schedule this for Friday"
- "Go live next week"

### 2. **Explain Limitation and Offer Alternatives**

**Message:**
> "I can't schedule articles for future publishing automatically.
> 
> **Alternatives:**
> 1. I can save it as a draft now, and you can tell me to publish it on [date]
> 2. Set a reminder for yourself to ask me to publish it then
> 3. I can publish it now if you're ready
> 
> Which would you prefer?"

### 3. **Proceed Based on Choice**

- Create as draft → [3.2_create_article_simple.md](../core_tasks/3.2_create_article_simple.md)
- Publish now → [3.6_publish_article.md](../core_tasks/3.6_publish_article.md)
- User sets external reminder

## Expected Outcome

User understands limitation and chooses viable alternative.

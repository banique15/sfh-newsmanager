# Requesting Features We Don't Have Yet

## Overview

User asks for a feature that doesn't exist: analytics, SEO optimization, translations, social media posting, etc.

We politely explain it's not available yet and may suggest workarounds or note the request.

## Why This Approach

Clear communication about current capabilities while being open to future enhancements.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Feature Request**

**Common requests:**
- "Show me analytics"
- "Optimize this for SEO"
- "Translate this to Spanish"
- "Post this to social media"
- "Add tags/categories"
- "Create a poll"

### 2. **Explain Politely**

**Message format:**
> "That feature isn't available yet. I currently focus on creating, updating, and publishing news articles.
> 
> [Optional: suggest workaround]
> [Optional: "I've noted your request for future consideration."]"

**Examples:**

**Analytics:**
> "I don't have analytics capabilities yet. For article analytics, please check your website dashboard or analytics platform."

**SEO/Translations:**
> "I don't handle SEO optimization or translations yet. You can manually edit the article for those needs, or use external tools."

**Social media:**
> "I only manage website news articles. For social media posting, please use your social media management tools."

## Expected Outcome

User understands current scope; their expectations are set correctly.

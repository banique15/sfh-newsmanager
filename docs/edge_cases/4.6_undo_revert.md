# "Undo That" or "Revert"

## Overview

User says "undo that", "revert", "go back", or "cancel that" after a change was already applied.

We don't have versioning/undo capability, so we explain this clearly and suggest manual correction.

## Why This Approach

Honesty about limitations prevents confusion and provides constructive alternatives.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Undo Request**

**Phrases:**
- "Undo that"
- "Revert"
- "Go back"
- "Cancel the change" (after it's done)

### 2. **Explain Limitation**

**Message:**
> "I can't undo changes automatically. The [create/update/delete/publish] has already been applied.
> 
> [Suggest manual fix based on what happened]"

**Specific examples:**

**After delete:**
> "I can't undo the deletion. The article has been permanently removed. If you have the content, I can help you recreate it."

**After update:**
> "I can't automatically revert the update. You can manually change it back, or let me know the previous content and I'll update it for you."

**After publish:**
> "I can't undo the publish automatically, but I can unpublish the article right now if you'd like."

## Expected Outcome

User understands undo isn't available and knows how to manually correct.

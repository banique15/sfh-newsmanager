# User Confirms a Change (Yes / Do it)

## Overview

We've sent a message explaining what we'll do (create, update, delete, publish, unpublish) with Yes and Cancel; the user clicks Yes (or "Do it").

This is the execution step after user approves a proposed action.

## Why This Approach

Clear confirmation flow ensures user approves exactly what will happen before we modify any data.

## Prerequisites

- **Required context:**
  - The proposed action (from previous step)
  - Article/content to act on
  
- **Required tools:**
  - Tool for the specific operation (article_crud, article_status, etc.)
  - `conversation_memory` - Track action result
  - `error_handler` - Format errors if something goes wrong

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Show "Working on it…"**

**Action:** So they know we received the confirmation.

**Message:**
> "Working on it..."

or

> "✓ Confirmed. Processing..."

---

### 2. **Perform Only the Proposed Action**

**Action:** Run the single operation we described.

**Execute the appropriate operation:**
- **Create article** → Use `article_crud` with operation="create"
- **Update article** → Use `article_crud` with operation="update"
- **Delete article** → Use `article_crud` with operation="delete"
- **Publish article** → Use `article_status` with operation="publish"
- **Unpublish article** → Use `article_status` with operation="unpublish"
- **Add image** → Use `article_crud` to update hero_image_url

**Only change what was proposed** - no additional operations.

---

### 3. **Confirm in Plain Language**

**Action:** Say what happened (success or simple error) and next steps.

**Tool(s) used:** `error_handler` (if needed)

**Success messages:**
- Created: "✅ Created '[TITLE]' as a draft. [Link]"
- Updated: "✅ Updated '[TITLE]'. [Link]"
- Deleted: "✅ Deleted '[TITLE]'."
- Published: "✅ '[TITLE]' is now live! [Link]"
- Unpublished: "✅ '[TITLE]' is no longer live."

**Error messages (plain language):**
- "Something went wrong creating the article. Please try again."
- "The article was saved, but the image didn't upload. Here's the article link."([4.8_partial_failure.md](../edge_cases/4.8_partial_failure.md))
- "I couldn't find that article anymore. It may have been deleted."

**Store in memory:** Result for potential follow-ups

---

## Expected Outcome

User sees that their confirmation was applied and gets a clear success or error message with actionable next steps.

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Operation succeeds** | Specific success message with link |
| **Partial failure** | Explain what worked and what didn't (see 4.8) |
| **Full failure** | Simple explanation, suggest try again |

# Create Simple Article (No Image)

## Overview

User asks to create an article without mentioning an image (e.g., "Write an article about the fundraiser").

This is the text-only article creation flow, which is faster and more focused than the full newsletter flow with images.

## Why This Approach

Following the same procedural flow as full article creation but skipping image generation keeps the response fast while maintaining proper confirmation before any database changes.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `intent_detection` - Parse user request for topic and requirements
  - `content_generation` - Generate headline, body, and excerpt
  - `article_crud` - Save article to database
  - `yes_no_prompt` - Generate confirmation UI
  - `conversation_memory` - Store article reference for follow-ups
  
- **Required context:**
  - Article topic (if not provided, must clarify)
  - Optional: tone, length, specific details
  
- **Channel considerations:**
  - Works identically across Slack, Email, and Portal
  - Confirmation format adapted to channel (buttons vs text)

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Understand the Request**
   
**Action:** Parse the user's message to extract topic, tone, and any specific requirements.

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`

**What to extract:**
- Article topic (required)
- Desired tone (infer if not specified)
- Length preference (default to medium if not specified)
- Specific details to include (dates, names, numbers, etc.)

**If topic is unclear or missing:**
- Go to [3.10_clarification.md](3.10_clarification.md) workflow
- Ask: "What should the article be about?"
- Wait for response before proceeding

**Example:**
- User: "Write an article about the fundraiser"
- Extracted: topic="fundraiser", tone="celebratory", length="medium"

---

### 2. **Draft the Content**

**Action:** Generate headline, body, and excerpt using the content generation tool.

**Tool(s) used:** `content_generation`

**Parameters:**
- Topic: [extracted from step 1]
- Tone: [extracted or inferred]
- Length: [extracted or default to medium]
- Organization context: Sing for Hope nonprofit mission

**Output:** JSON with `title`, `excerpt`, and `content` fields

**Example reference:** See [examples/prompts/article_generation.md](../../examples/prompts/article_generation.md)

---

### 3. **Ask for Confirmation Before Saving**

**Action:** Summarize what will be created and present Yes/Cancel options.

**Tool(s) used:** `yes_no_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
I'll create a new article titled '[GENERATED_TITLE]' as a draft. 
[Show brief excerpt or first line of content]

Is this correct?
```

**Options:** [Yes] [Cancel]

**Example:**
> "I'll create a new article titled 'Winter Fundraiser Exceeds Goals' as a draft. The article will cover the fundraiser's success and thank supporters. Is this correct?"
> 
> [Yes] [Cancel]

**Next steps:**
- If user clicks **Yes** → Continue to step 4
- If user clicks **Cancel** → Go to [3.12_user_cancels.md](3.12_user_cancels.md)

---

### 4. **Save After Approval**

**Action:** Create the article in the database with status="draft".

**Tool(s) used:** `article_crud`

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "operation": "create",
  "title": "[generated title]",
  "content": "[generated content]",
  "excerpt": "[generated excerpt]",
  "status": "draft",
  "author": "Newsletter Manager Bot"
}
```

**Handle errors:**
- If `DUPLICATE_TITLE`: Follow [4.1_duplicate_titles.md](../edge_cases/4.1_duplicate_titles.md)
- If `DATABASE_ERROR`: Use `error_handler` tool for plain language explanation

**On success:**
- Store article ID and title in `conversation_memory` for follow-up references
- Continue to step 5

---

### 5. **Confirm to the User**

**Action:** Tell them the article was created and how to access it.

**Message format:**
```
✅ Created '[ARTICLE_TITLE]' as a draft.

[If available: link to article]
[Next steps: "You can publish it, edit it, or add a hero image."]
```

**Example:**
> "✅ Created 'Winter Fundraiser Exceeds Goals' as a draft.
> 
> View it here: [link]
> 
> Let me know if you'd like to publish it, make changes, or add a hero image!"

---

## Expected Outcome

A new draft article exists in the database with:
- Generated title, content, and excerpt
- Status set to "draft" (not live on website)
- Stored in conversation memory for easy follow-up ("publish it", "add an image to it")
- User received clear confirmation with next steps

## Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| **Topic unclear** | Ask "What should the article be about?" (see 3.10) |
| **Duplicate title** | Ask if they want to create with different title or update existing (see 4.1) |
| **Save failed** | "Something went wrong saving the article. Please try again or rephrase your request." |
| **User cancels** | "No problem. Let me know if you need anything else." (see 3.12) |

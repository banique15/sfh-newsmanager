# Thread vs New Message in Slack

## Overview

In Slack, user starts a thread on a previous message vs posting a new message in the channel.

Thread context should be preserved; new top-level messages start fresh context.

## Why This Approach

Threads indicate continuation of a topic; new messages often indicate new requests.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Message Type**

**Thread reply:**
- Use parent message as context
- Access conversation from that thread

**New channel message:**
- Start with fresh context or most recent channel interaction

### 2. **Use Appropriate Context**

**Tool(s) used:** `conversation_memory`, `context_resolution`

**In thread:**
- "Publish it" → refers to article discussed in thread
- Access thread history for pronouns

**In new message:**
- "Publish it" → refers to most recent article in channel
- May need clarification if no recent context

## Expected Outcome

Context properly scoped to thread vs channel level.

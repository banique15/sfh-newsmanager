# Request About Something That's Not News (Out of Scope)

## Overview

User asks to change a static page, an event listing, a donation form, or something that isn't a news article.

We politely say we only handle news articles and suggest they contact the right team or use the right tool.

## Why This Approach

Clear scope boundaries prevent confusion and direct users to appropriate resources.

## Prerequisites

None - simple response

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Out-of-Scope Request**

**Examples:**
- "Update the About Us page"
- "Change the event calendar"
- "Fix the donation form"
- "Update program descriptions"

---

### 2. **Politely Decline and Suggest Alternative**

**Message format:**
```
I only handle news articles (blog posts) for the website.

For [type of content], please contact [appropriate team/resource].

Is there a news article I can help you with instead?
```

**Examples:**

**Static pages:**
> "I only handle news articles (blog posts) for the website. For changes to static pages like About Us, please contact the web development team. Is there a news article I can help you with instead?"

**Event listings:**
> "I only handle news articles. For event calendar updates, please use the Events Management system. Is there a news article about an event I can help you create?"

**General:**
> "I'm focused on news content (articles and blog posts). For other website changes, please contact the appropriate team. Is there a news article I can help you with?"

## Expected Outcome

User understands our scope and either provides a news-related request or contacts appropriate resource.

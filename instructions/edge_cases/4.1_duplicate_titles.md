# Duplicate or Very Similar Titles

## Overview

User asks to create an article with a title that already exists or is very similar to an existing article.

We detect the overlap and ask the user to confirm or clarify: create new with different title, or update the existing one.

## Why This Approach

Prevents accidental duplicates and helps user decide whether they meant to create new content or modify existing content.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `article_search` - Check for existing similar titles
  - `clarification_prompt` - Ask what they want to do
  - `yes_no_prompt` - Get confirmation on chosen path

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect the Overlap**

**Action:** Check existing titles when creating new article.

**Tool(s) used:** `article_search`

**When to check:**
- After generating title for new article
- Before saving to database

**Match criteria:**
- Exact title match
- Very similar (e.g., "Summer Event 2026" vs "Summer Event")

---

### 2. **Ask User to Confirm or Clarify**

**Action:** Show the existing article and ask what they want to do.

**Tool(s) used:** `clarification_prompt`

**Message format:**
```
We already have an article with a similar title:
- '[EXISTING_TITLE]' ([status: draft/published])

Do you want to:
1. Create a new article with a different title
2. Update the existing article

Which would you like?
```

**Example:**
> "We already have an article titled 'Summer Concert Series'. It's currently a draft.
> 
> Do you want to:
> 1. Create a new article with a different title (like 'Summer Concert Series 2026')
> 2. Update the existing 'Summer Concert Series' article
> 
> Which would you like?"

---

### 3. **Proceed Based on Choice**

**Option 1: Create new with different title**
- Ask "What title should I use for the new article?"
- Or suggest: "How about '[TITLE] 2026'?"
- Create with new title
- Follow [3.2_create_article_simple.md](../core_tasks/3.2_create_article_simple.md)

**Option 2: Update existing**
- Proceed to update flow
- Follow [3.4_update_content.md](../core_tasks/3.4_update_content.md)

---

## Expected Outcome

User explicitly chooses whether to create new or update existing, preventing accidental duplicates.

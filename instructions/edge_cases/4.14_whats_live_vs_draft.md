# "What's Live Right Now?" vs "What's in Draft?"

## Overview

User asks "What's live?", "What's published?", "What's in draft?", "What haven't we published yet?"

These are read-only list requests filtered by status. We fetch the right set and present the list.

## Why This Approach

Status-specific queries are common and straightforward - just filter by status and display.

## Prerequisites

- **Required tools:**
  - `article_search` - Filter by status

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Status Query**

**Common phrasings:**

**Published/Live:**
- "What's live?"
- "Show published articles"
- "What's on the website?"
- "What have we published?"

**Draft:**
- "What's in draft?"
- "Show me drafts"
- "What haven't we published?"
- "What's not live yet?"

### 2. **Fetch by Status**

**Tool(s) used:** `article_search`

**For "What's live?":**
```json
{
  "status": "published",
  "sort_by": "published_at",
  "sort_order": "desc",
  "limit": 10-20
}
```

**For "What's in draft?":**
```json
{
  "status": "draft",
  "sort_by": "updated_at",
  "sort_order": "desc",
  "limit": 10-20
}
```

### 3. **Present List**

**Include:**

- Brief excerpts
- Links if available

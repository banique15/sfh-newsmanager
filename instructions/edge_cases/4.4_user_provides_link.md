# User Provides a URL/Link to an Article

## Overview

User sends a link to an existing article and says "update this" or "publish this" or "delete this".

We extract the article ID from the URL and proceed with the requested operation after confirmation.

## Why This Approach

URLs uniquely identify articles, making them reliable for targeting specific content.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Extract Article ID from URL**

**Tool(s) used:** `intent_detection`, `context_resolution`

**Extract from URL patterns:**
- Domain/article-slug → resolve to ID
- Domain/articles/123 → ID is 123

###2. **Proceed with Requested Operation**

**Follow appropriate workflow:**
- "Update this" → [3.4_update_content.md](../core_tasks/3.4_update_content.md)
- "Publish this" → [3.6_publish_article.md](../core_tasks/3.6_publish_article.md)
- "Delete this" → [3.5_delete_content.md](../core_tasks/3.5_delete_content.md)

**Confirm with article title in message**

## Expected Outcome

Article identified by URL, operation performed after confirmation.

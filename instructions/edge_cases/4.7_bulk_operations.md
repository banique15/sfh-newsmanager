# Bulk Operations (e.g., "Publish All Drafts")

## Overview

User asks "publish all drafts", "delete all old articles", or similar bulk operations.

Bulk changes are risky. We either ask them to specify which ones or confirm the full list before acting.

## Why This Approach

Bulk operations on wrong set of articles can cause major issues. Explicit confirmation of exact set is critical.

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1. **Detect Bulk Request**

**Phrases:**
- "Publish all drafts"
- "Delete all articles about X"
- "Unpublish everything"

### 2. **Show What Would Be Affected**

**Tool(s) used:** `article_search`, `clarification_prompt`

**Fetch matching set and show list:**

**Message:**
> "This will [publish/delete/unpublish] the following articles:
> 
> 1. [Title 1] - [status]
> 2. [Title 2] - [status]
> 3. [Title 3] - [status]
> ...
> 
> Total: [N] articles
> 
> Are you sure you want to proceed?"

### 3. **Require Explicit Confirmation**

**Tool(s) used:** `yes_no_prompt`

**Options:** [Yes, proceed with all] [Cancel]

**On Yes:** Apply operation to each article in list

**On Cancel:** "No problem. No articles were changed."

## Expected Outcome

User sees exact list of what will be affected and confirms before bulk operation executes.
